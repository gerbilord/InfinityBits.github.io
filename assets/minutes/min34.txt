testing methodologies:
we are required to do coverage testing C0 (statement coverage) and C1 (branch coverage)
need to name a member of team as "tester"
create 500 use cases?
person who creates the use cases for a feature should not be the person who developed the feature
testing generates a report - "x lines executed..."
table containing all the use cases and showing which ones passed
